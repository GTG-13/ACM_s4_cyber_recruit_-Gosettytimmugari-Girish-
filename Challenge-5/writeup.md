I need to Hack potter...

I captured professor quirrell network activity though capturing the packets. Help me to solve it.

Analysis and Solving:

  A set of packets were given. I opened it in wireshark. I tried to filter for simpleness. I first filtered ony http and by observing there were some images. So I extracted them into my files.

  There were a total of 5 images. I used strings for every picture and got the flag in two parts. Part1 was in ron photo and the part was in hermoni.

  Flag: ACM{w3_4r3_cyb3rw1tch3s_$nd_w1z4rds}
