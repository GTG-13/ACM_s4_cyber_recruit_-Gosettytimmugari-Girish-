**Compiled While Intoxicated**

Someone once said, "This word was created by someone on morphine, cocaine, and alcohol at the same time."

Absurd origin story? Maybe. But the word exists — and it’s hiding somewhere. A suspicious obsession with hex and some strange bases can be observed.

Follow the encodings instead of fighting them. The trail will eventually point you to something that exists outside this file.

Analysis and solving:

There was a file named rock.class". I cannot open the code directly and read it. I first runned the code I got :"m0rph111n3".

I used some AI and got the code inside the file. After analysing the code can give only one output for everytime. And there were two strings in an array. I tried few things like decoding thema and etc but i couldn't move forward. 

Then I got an Idea since the last step of this was osint(from the description given) I searched it in google as "This word was created by someone on morphine, cocaine, and alcohol at the same time." I got an instagram reel in which a man says the same things about a german name. Luckly it was the flag. I lack knowledge in rev and iit is also one of the things i wanted to learn in club.
