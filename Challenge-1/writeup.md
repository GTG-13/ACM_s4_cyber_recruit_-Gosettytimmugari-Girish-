**Restaurant**

So last time I went to this place with my friend i ate in a restaurant which was opened in 1980. We ate chicken biryani in the ground floor of that restaurant. I don’t remember the price, can you find out?

Analysis
  There is a photo with it which is taken near charminar. So, I checked all the hotels menu near the area of charminar in maps. I was trying all possibilities and tried my luck with price 260. I tried 160 since it was in a hotel menu and in frustation of getting wrong i did 260.

Flag: ACM{260}
